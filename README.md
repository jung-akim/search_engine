## Project 5 Proposal by Jung-a Kim
### Background
Since COVID-19, e-commerce market value has risen by dramatically and the companies are more competitive in satisfying customer's needs.
One of the keys in determining the purchase is the reviews. According to BrightLocal's Local Consumer Review Survey 2014, 88% of consumers say they trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations and the average consumer reads 10 reviews before feeling able to trust a business<br>

### The goal of this project
For both consumers and the company, the goal is to retrieve the optimal product with most relevant reviews about pros and cons that consumers would want to check before purchasing.

### What is the plan for this project?
The input would be a few sentences with keywords that the consumer is looking for in a product. The first output is the product that matches the key qualities with positive sentiment based on the reviews. After the optimal product is chosen, the reviews will be divided into pros and cons and sorted in terms of relevancy to the query. Each review can be summarized into few sentences, if too long.

### Dataset
The dataset is from "Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset" that are publicly available in S3 bucket in AWS US East Region. The dataset used for this project is the subset of "amazon_reviews_us_Electronics_v1_00.tsv" file which contains information of each review on different electronics. It has 3,093,869 reviews. There may be other datasets for training a model such as sentiment or summary.
Dataset download instruction and description is in this [link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html)

### Tools
tensorflow_hub has Universal Sentence Encoding which is a context-based sentence embedding that uses transformers. USE is developed by google in 2018 which can be used for text similarity, sentiment analysis, etc. For summarization, PEGASUS - Reddit_TIFU was used.
