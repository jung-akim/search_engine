    "review1 = \"My wife and I bought this keyboard for our new HTPC and were very excited about the size. The size and the feel of the keyboard are great. It feels very solid in the hands and works automatically upon connecting the USB dongle. After using it for a few moments, we soon realized the horrible mouse function of the keyboard. We have a 52 inch flatscreen tv which is about 10 feet away from our couch. We constantly had to recenter the mouse pointer because we would be pointing the device far off screen and the cursor would only move a few inches. We changed all the sensitivities going up and down to no avail. After using the mouse for a while, my hands would be bent at weird angles just to make it across the screen. Eventually the mouse began to move by itself to the left which made things even harder. It was a struggle to enjoy something that we hoped would be alot of fun. While the keyboard functions worked well, the horrible mouse function more than overshadows it.\"\n",
    "review2 = \"I ordered this as a keyboard/mouse for my HTPC. I liked the size of the product and the listed features. A gyroscopic mouse sounded intuitive and convenient. Unfortunately, it was not. The keyboard worked well eventually. I had to plug a regular keyboard in to get the PC to boot, but after the first boot, the full keyboard was never needed. Typing on the keyboard was easy enough--a good thumbboard with nice media keys for windows. The mouse function, on the other hand, was terrible. The gyroscope functioned poorly and wouldn't center the mouse pointer when the mouse was centered. The device was advertised as not needing any software calibration, but I'm betting the performance would have benefited from some sort of calibration. Without calibration, there was no way to recenter the pointer, so you had to twist your wrists awkwardly to try to get the mouse from one edge of the screen to the other. The device also suffered from poor RF performance, suggesting that it wasn't really RF at all, but rather IF connection. This means that I'd have to have line-of-sight to the receiver by sticking the receiver into a front usb port, rather than hiding the receiver in back. That's a poor option for an HTPC remote.

    "Very nice little keyboard. For some reason I was expecting it to be a bit bigger, but not disappointed. It fits in the hands nicely and has a good feel.
