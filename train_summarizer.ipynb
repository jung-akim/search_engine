It feels very solid in the hands and works automatically upon connecting the USB dongle. After using it for a few moments, we soon realized the horrible mouse function of the keyboard. We have a 52 inch flatscreen tv which is about 10 feet away from our couch. We constantly had to recenter the mouse pointer because we would be pointing the device far off screen and the cursor would only move a few inches. We changed all the sensitivities going up and down to no avail. After using the mouse for a while, my hands would be bent at weird angles just to make it across the screen. Eventually the mouse began to move by itself to the left which made things even harder. It was a struggle to enjoy something that we hoped would be alot of fun.
